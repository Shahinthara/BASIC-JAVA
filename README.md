Compound Assignment Operators
There are also compound assignment operators that perform an operation and then assign the result back to the variable. Let's look at a few:

x -= 5        (Subtracts 5 from x and assigns the result back to x)
x *= 3        (Multiplies x by 3 and assigns the result back to x)
x /= 3        (Divides x by 3 and assigns the result back to x)
x %= 3        (Finds the remainder when x is divided by 3 and assigns the result back to x)
Task
Using an assignment operator, output the remainder when length is divided by 3.


class Codechef
{
	public static void main (String[] args)
	{
	    int length = 11;
	    length%=3;
	    System.out.println(length);
		
	}
}

Your Output
2

Basic Comparison
Here are some more examples of relational operators:

a > b          (Checks if a is greater than b)
a == b        (Checks if a is equal to b)
a != b        (Checks if a is not equal to b)
a >= b        (Checks if a is greater than or equal to b)
a <= b        (Checks if a is less than or equal to b)

Task
You are given two variables height1 and height2.
Output true if they are equal else false.

import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;
import java.io.*;

class Codechef
{
	public static void main (String[] args) throws java.lang.Exception
	{
	    int height1 = 15;
	    int height2 = 13;
	    System.out.println(height1 == height2);
	}
}
Your Output
false

Basic Logical Operations
Here are the basic logical operators and their usage:

&&   (Logical AND: returns true only if both conditions are true)
a > 5 && a < 10  // returns true only if a is greater than 5 but less than 10
||  (Logical OR: returns true if at least one condition is true)
a > 10 || a < 5  // returns true if a is greater than 10 or less than 5
!   (Logical NOT: reverses the result of the condition)
!(a > 5 && a < 10) // returns true in the opposite cases of the first condition above

Task
You are given a variable height.
You are allowed to enter the waterpark only if your height is between 5 and 10 (Inclusive).
Apply the condition and output 
1
1 if condition is true or 
0
0 if condition is false as applicable.

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int height = 15;
        // Update the blanks in the code below
        if(5<height && height>15)
        {
            System.out.println(1);
        }
        else{
            System.out.println(0);
        }
    }
}
Your Output
0

Conditional Operator
Syntax:
condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false;
Explanation:
condition: This is the expression to be evaluated. If it is true, the operator returns value_if_true; otherwise, it returns value_if_false.
value_if_true: This is the value returned if the condition evaluates to true.
value_if_false: This is the value returned if the condition evaluates to false.
Example:
int a = 10, b = 5;
int max = (a > b) ? a : b;
In this example:

(a > b) is the condition.
a is value_if_true.
b is value_if_false.
If a is greater than b, max will be assigned the value of a; otherwise, it will be assigned the value of b.

Task
Given an integer, print 0 if its odd, else print 1.
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int num = 15;
        System.out.println((num % 2 == 1) ? 0 : 1);
    }
}

Your Output
0

Solve this problem - 1
You are given the age of a person as the variable age.
Will this person be able to vote?
Output 1 or 0 assuming that the voting age is 18
i.e., a person's age has to be greater than or equal to 18 to vote.

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int age = 20;
        // Update the blank in code below
        System.out.println((age >= 18) ? 1 : 0);
    }
}
Your Output
1


Solve this problem - 2
You are given the name of a teen as the variable name.
There is a special rule in Chef town - You will get special treatment if your name is C or A.

Output the following:

1 if the name is A or C.
0 otherwise.

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        char name = 'D';
        // Update the blank in code below
        System.out.println((name=='C'||name=='A') ? 1 : 0); // Use single quotes for individual characters
        }
    }

Your Output
0

Operator Precedence

Type conversion and type casting
Example:

int a = 5;
float b = 2.5f; // note the 'f' suffix to denote a float literal in Java
float result = a + b; // 'a' is automatically changed to a float before adding.
System.out.println(result);  // prints 7.5


Example:

int a = 10;
int b = 3;
float result = (float)a / b; // Here, 'a' is explicitly changed to a float before dividing.
System.out.println(result);  // prints 3.33

Task
In the IDE, create a variable result of type float which stores the result with decimal value when a is divided by b, then print it.

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 14;
        int b = 5;
        float result = (float)a / b;
        System.out.println(result);
    }
}
Your Output
2.8

INCREMENT AND DECREMENT
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 5;
        int b = 3;
        int result = a++ - --b + a--;
        System.out.println(result);
    }
}
- a++: 5 (increments a to 6 for future use)
- --b: 2
- a--: 6 (decrements a to 5 for future use)

Now, perform the arithmetic:
5 - 2 + 6 = 9
So, result will be 9.
